"""The runner/service protocol: every type that crosses the boundary, and the audit log of crossings.

The split is the product decision. Candidate selection, diff splitting, prompt authoring and oracle
construction never leave the service, because none of them need the customer's toolchain. Everything
that *does* need the toolchain — collecting git facts, running a test suite, running an agent — is
dumb enough to hand to a runner in the customer's CI.

So a runner never receives a "task". It receives `WorkOrder`s: check out this commit, apply this
patch, run this command, report the exit code. It is not told which patch is a scaffold and which is
a gold fix, which candidate survived validation, or why any commit was chosen. The judgment stays
server-side; the runner reports exit codes.

Every value defined here is JSON, and `Wire.crossing` records each one to disk. That makes the egress
claim auditable rather than asserted: after a run, `wire/` *is* the list of what left the repository.
